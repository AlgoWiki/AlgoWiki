A *number theoretic transform* is similar to a [fast Fourier transform](Fast Fourier transform), but instead of using complex [roots of unity](Root of unity), [roots of unity modulo $n$](Root of unity modulo n) are used. This allows computing convolutions where arithmetic is taken modulo $n$, and thus avoids using floating point numbers as is the case for fast Fourier transform.
