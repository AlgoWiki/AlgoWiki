A generating function is a [formal power series](Formal power series) where the coefficient at $x^n$ usually counts the number of combinatorial objects of size $n$.

Sometimes the coefficients are normalized, as is the case with [exponential generating functions](Exponential generating function), where the $n$<sup>th</sup> coefficient is divided by $n!$. This can give the operations on the series a different meaning.
