## In directed acyclic graphs
Path cover in a [directed acyclic graph](Directed acyclic graph) can be reduced to [vertex-disjoint path cover](Vertex-disjoint path cover) in a directed acyclic graph by first taking the [transitive closure](Transitive closure).

> **Insight**: If a directed acyclic graph is transitive (i.e. is its own transitive closure), as is the case for [partially ordered sets](Partially ordered set), then the path cover problem is equivalent to the vertex-disjoint path 
cover problem.
