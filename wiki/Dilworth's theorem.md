*Dilworth's theorem* states that the length of a longest [antichain](Partially ordered set#Antichain) in a [partially ordered set](Partially ordered set) $S$ is equal to the size of a minimum [partition](Partition) of $S$ into [chains](Partially ordered set#chain).

If the poset is represented as a [directed acyclic graph](Directed acyclic graph), the minimum partition into chains is equivalent to the [vertex-disjoint path cover](Vertex-disjoint path cover) problem.

> **Note**: Posets are [transitive](Transitivity) by nature. If a poset is represented in compressed form as a DAG, then the [transitive closure](Transitive closure) must be taken before computing the vertex-disjoint path cover.
