## Operations

### Multiplication
Multiplying two finite formal power series is the same as multiplying two polynomials. That can be done in $O(n\log n)$ time with [Fast Fourier transform]().

### Division
Calculating the multiplicative inverse of a formal power series can be done in $O(n\log n)$. [^1]

### Square root
Calculating the square root of a formal power series can be done in $O(n\log n)$. [^1]
