A *Depth-first search tree* can be constructed by running [depth-first search](Depth-first search) on a directed or undirected graph. The resulting tree can be used to discover [bridges](Bridge), [articulation points](Articulation point), [strongly connected components](Strongly connected component) and other [cycle](Graph cycle)-related properties of the original graph.
