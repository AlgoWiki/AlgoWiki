- TODO: Wait for problems to be published to https://2018.bapc.eu/. Reference that directly, but also archive to archive.algo.is.
- TODO: Explain the problem, and give the constructive algorithm for determining bisimilarity. (Hint: Use fixed-point iteration on a set of vertices. Always guaranteed to work due to Tarski's fixed-point theorem).

## DFA equivalence
How does this problem relate to equivalence of DFA's?

- TODO: Make page about that.
