- TODO: Wait for problems to be published to https://2018.bapc.eu/. Reference that directly, but also archive to archive.algo.is.
- TODO: Explain the problem, and give the constructive algorithm for determining bisimilarity. (Hint: Use fixed-point iteration on a set of groups of vertices (where each group represents a candidate group of bisimilar vertices). Always guaranteed to work due to Tarski's fixed-point theorem).

## DFA equivalence
How does this problem relate to equivalence of DFA's?

- TODO: Make page about that.
- Problem: [Outsourcing](https://open.kattis.com/problems/outsourcing) [^1]
